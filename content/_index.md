      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I work on algorithmic foundations for multi-objective optimization problems with societal considerations. From algorithmic design with fairness considerations to evaluating resource-allocation systems with equity and incentive alignment, I am particularly interested in designing algorithms to improve people's access to information and opportunities. I obtained my Ph.D. from Columbia University and my B.A. in Mathematics from Princeton University.

    Since 2019, I has been co-organizing the [EAAMO Bridges initiative](https://bridges.eaamo.org), formerly known as MD4SG. I am a co-founder of the ACM conference series on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization, for which together served as a Program Co-Chair for the inaugural edition together with Rediet Abebe and Irene Lo. Check out [ACM EAAMO'25]((https://conference.eaamo.org)), taking place at the University of Pittsburgh, Nov 5-7, 2025!
