I'm a Research Group Leader in the [Social Foundations for Computation Department](https://is.mpg.de/sf/) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen, advised by [Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Columbia University in 2022, supervised by [Augustin Chaintreau](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/augustin-chaintreau). I spent Fall 2022 as a Simons Fellow at the Simons Instiute for Theory of Computing at University of California at Berkeley, attending the Graph Limits and Processes on Networks program.
